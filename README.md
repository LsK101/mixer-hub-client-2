# MixerHub2

It's MixerHub, but it's actually going to look aesthetically pleasing and be fun to use.

(Below is copied from MixerHub's readme) 

MixerHub is a way to create, share, and discover new drink recipes.

Users can use the recipe creator to come up with new and tasty recipes for them to share with others. Fine tune the strength of your recipes with the ABV calculator that updates live as you change your ingredients.

Recipes can easily be deleted or modified if you decide that you've come up with something a little better than what you had.

A statistics page tracks your contributions to the app, showing what others think of your recipes and what you think about other's recipes as a whole.
