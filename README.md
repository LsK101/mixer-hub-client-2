# MixerHub2

MixerHub(1) was my first React project, and MixerHub2 is a complete rewrite on the front-end (and possibly some on the API) mainly with the following goals:
-make it actually aesthetically pleasing to look at (color scheme)
-make it easier to use (layout)
-full redux implementation, keep all components stateless
-keep the code and file tree neat and readable this time

(Below is copied from MixerHub's readme, to get an idea of the intended features) 

MixerHub is a way to create, share, and discover new drink recipes.

Users can use the recipe creator to come up with new and tasty recipes for them to share with others. Fine tune the strength of your recipes with the ABV calculator that updates live as you change your ingredients.

Recipes can easily be deleted or modified if you decide that you've come up with something a little better than what you had.

Discover what other users have come up with and rate their recipes to show them what you think.

A statistics page tracks your contributions to the app, showing what others think of your recipes and what you think about other's recipes as a whole.
